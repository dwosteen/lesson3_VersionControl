            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began with the Linux kernel, a fairly large open source software project. Originally software changes and developments were sent as patches and archived files. To remedy this the users started using a commercial service called “bitkeeper”. However the relationship between the Linux community and bitkeeper eventually degraded and the ability to use BitKeeper for free was revoked. This created an opportunity for the original developers of Linux to create a tool based on BitKeeper, but altering it in such a way that it would be more compatible with the community’s needs. Since its creation Git has become the pinnacle in its field, while also becoming incredibly user friendly without sacrificing speed or file size.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So what is Git? Well the main difference between Git and other version control systems is the way Git interprets the data. Most other systems store data in a list of file based changes. Git does not function this way, instead it processes data more similarly to a series of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every commit, or save, of your project it essentially takes a picture of the file system at the time of commitment and takes an exact copy. It only saves the changes files, as it can load unchanged pages from previous commits. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two main ways to get a Git repository. The first is to take an existing project and import it to Git. The other clones an existing Git repository into a new one, from another server. If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory. If you have never done this there are multiple different instructions depending on which system you run. This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all necessary files. Ideally you can start version controlling existing files, start tracking those files and do an initial commit.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"></p>To get a copy of an existing Git repository, like a project you have started or would like to contribute to, you need to use the command git clone. Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. If your server disk gets corrupted you can use nearly any of the clones on any client to et the server back to its original state, however all versioned data will no longer be there.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things. So while it’s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there’s a good chance that you’ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally. This is because Github is the easiest way to share projects with others across the world.</p>
